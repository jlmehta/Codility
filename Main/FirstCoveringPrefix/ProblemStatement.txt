Given an Array, find the First Covering Prefix for that array.
First Covering Prefix is the index P in the given array such that the subarray until that index contains 
all the distinct values int he input array.

For example, the first covering prefix of the following 5−element array A:
    A[0] = 2  
    A[1] = 2  
    A[2] = 1
    A[3] = 0  
    A[4] = 1

is 3, because sequence [ A[0], A[1], A[2], A[3] ] equal to [2, 2, 1, 0], contains all values that occur in array A.
