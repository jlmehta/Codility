Given a switch board (2d array of switches), every wwitch can have 3 possible values: -1, 0 or +1

If the value is 0, the ball passes through withoout changing its direction.
If the value is -1, the ball leaves through the bottom side. 
If the value is +1, the ball leaves through the right side.
Each time a ball passes through a cell, the value is negated.
All balls enter the board from the top side of the first (0,0) switch.

If k balls enter the board, compute how many pass through the switchboard from the bottom of the bottom-right switch?	


Example
If 4 balls enter the below switchboard

|-1| 0|+1|
----------
|+1| 0| 0|

only the second ball exits down the bottom-right switch.
